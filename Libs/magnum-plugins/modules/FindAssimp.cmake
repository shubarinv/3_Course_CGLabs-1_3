# Find Assimp
# -------------
#
# Finds the Assimp library. This module defines:
#
#  Assimp_FOUND           - True if Assimp library is found
#  Assimp::Assimp         - Assimp imported target
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  Assimp_LIBRARY         - Assimp library
#  Assimp_INCLUDE_DIR     - Include dir
