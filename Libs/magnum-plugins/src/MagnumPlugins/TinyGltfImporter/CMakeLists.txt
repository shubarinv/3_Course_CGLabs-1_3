# I could include tinygltf directly, but I want to suppress the warnings from
# it, so doing it this way. Also: it's PRIVATE, because the file is not (and
# should *never* be) included in a public header due to its extreme size.
#
# Unfortunately, json.hpp uses the weird `and`, `or` and `not` keywords instead
# of &&, || and ! (WHY?!), and for some reason that breaks on clang-cl when the
# directory is included as SYSTEM: https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/1818
# However I refuse to upgrade because the new versions are more than twice as
# large as what's embedded here and I have no interest in TinyGltfImporter
# inflating my compile times even further. That damn thing takes 20 seconds
# alone, ALL OTHER 30 plugins get fully compiled and linked in less than that.
#
# This. combined with CMake 3.19 that implements support for SYSTEM includes on
# clang-cl (https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/5231, not
# listed in the changelogs) and AppVeyor updating on 2020-12-15 to CMake 3.19
# (https://www.appveyor.com/updates/2020/12/15/) resulted in a sudden
# infuriating build failure on a FRIDAY EVENING. Working around this by not
# using SYSTEM on clang-cl for now, the rewritten cgltf-based importer can't
# come soon enough so I can throw this garbage away.
