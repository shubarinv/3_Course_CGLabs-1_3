# Assimp 5. Of all the things that could break, this version reports itself as
# 4.1. Since some of the insane awful bugs got fixed in version 5, the test has
# to check against the version in order to adjust expectations. The only way I
# could make this work is checking for the getEpsilon() function added in
# https://github.com/assimp/assimp/commit/8b95479bb00b4bf8fb875f2c5b0605ddfd203b7f
